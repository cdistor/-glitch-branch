Photo Album for The Stranded Closet Inventory
This uses Airtable as the Database 
Louie (is the original)
===================
Louie.glitch.me is a project dedicated to an amazing pup named Louie. 
If you would also like to make a photo site dedicated to your favorite creature or thing in your life you can!
You can see it in action at [louie.glitch.me](louie.glitch.me)

How to make your own photo site:
===================
1. sign up for an account with [airtable](https://airtable.com/) 
2. create a new base to store all the photos you care to share. Feel free to copy [this base](https://airtable.com/shrNrdIUSqjVljGTQ) to have the same format as what's featured in the app.
3. remix this glitch app
4. in your key.env file add your key, base id, and base name
5. update the text in views/index.html with the text you want
6. Reach out to Cassey to get your app added to the [Ring of Pets](https://ring-of-pets.glitch.me/) webring (or delete the script embed in the footer in views/index.html if you don't want your pet to join the [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring]))
7. bonus-pro-tip: download the airtable app on your phone to add pictures to your website faster and with greater ease :)
